## 5. Data Warehousing Roadmap

### Overview
A data warehouse is a system used for reporting and data analysis, and is a central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.

### Roadmap

#### 5.1 Data Warehouse Concepts
- **ETL in Data Warehousing**: Importance of ETL in DW.
- **Star Schema**: Fact tables, dimension tables, and relationships.
- **Snowflake Schema**: A more complex version of star schema.
- **OLAP vs OLTP**: Understanding the difference between analytical and transactional systems.

#### 5.2 Data Modeling
- **Fact Tables**: Metrics, facts, and transactional data.
- **Dimension Tables**: Hierarchies, attributes, and descriptive data.
- **Data Warehouse Design**: Designing and implementing a data warehouse schema.

#### 5.3 Data Warehouse Architecture
- **Inmon vs Kimball**: Different approaches to designing data warehouses.
- **ETL Tools**: Tools for extracting, transforming, and loading data.
- **Data Marts**: Subsets of the data warehouse tailored to specific business functions.

#### 5.4 Data Warehouse Maintenance and Performance
- **Data Aggregation**: How to store and query aggregated data.
- **Partitioning and Indexing**: Improving query performance in large datasets.
- **Data Refresh Strategy**: How to implement efficient data refreshes in a data warehouse.
  
### Problem Statements/Questions for Data Warehousing:
1. Design a star schema for a retail company, including fact tables for sales and dimension tables for time, product, and customer.
2. Implement a slowly changing dimension (SCD) type 2 in your data warehouse to handle customer address changes.
3. How would you design a data warehouse for a financial institution, focusing on regulatory and reporting needs?
4. Optimize a query that retrieves monthly sales data from a large data warehouse table that is running slow.
5. How would you design a data refresh strategy for a data warehouse with a high volume of transactions?
