## 3. SSAS (SQL Server Analysis Services) Roadmap

### Overview
SSAS is used for building OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) and Data Mining models. It is primarily used for building multidimensional models (OLAP cubes) and tabular models.

### Roadmap

#### 3.1 SSAS Architecture
- **SSAS Models**: OLAP (Multidimensional) vs Tabular.
- **Data Sources**: Connecting to SQL Server, flat files, and other data sources.
- **Dimensions and Measures**: Defining and managing dimensions and measures.
- **Cubes**: Building OLAP cubes using SSAS.
  
#### 3.2 Multidimensional Modeling
- **Creating a Cube**: Using SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) to design cubes.
- **Measures and Dimensions**: Adding measures, dimensions, hierarchies.
- **Calculated Members**: Writing MDX (Multidimensional Expressions) queries for calculated members.
- **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**: Defining and using KPIs in your cube.
- **MDX Queries**: Writing MDX queries for OLAP cubes.

#### 3.3 Tabular Modeling
- **Tabular Models**: Creating and managing tabular models.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Writing DAX formulas for calculated columns and measures.
- **Relationships in Tabular Models**: Defining relationships between tables.
- **Data Refresh**: How to schedule and perform data refreshes in tabular models.

#### 3.4 Advanced SSAS Concepts
- **Partitioning**: Optimizing cubes by partitioning data.
- **Security**: Row-level security in SSAS.
- **Caching and Processing**: Optimizing cube processing and caching.
- **Query Optimization**: Improving query performance in multidimensional and tabular models.
  
### Problem Statements/Questions for SSAS:
1. Create an SSAS cube for a sales dataset that includes sales by region and time, and define calculated measures like `Total Sales` and `Avg Sales`.
2. Implement a tabular model in SSAS and use DAX to create a calculated column for "Profit Margin".
3. Write an MDX query to retrieve the total sales for a specific region in an SSAS cube.
4. Implement row-level security in SSAS so that a user can only view data for their assigned region.
5. Optimize an SSAS cube that is running very slowly during processing.
6. Create a KPI in SSAS to monitor the sales performance against a target.
