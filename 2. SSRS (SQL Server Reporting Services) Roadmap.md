## 2. SSRS (SQL Server Reporting Services) Roadmap

### Overview
SSRS is a tool for creating, managing, and delivering reports in SQL Server. It allows you to design, deploy, and render reports from various data sources.

### Roadmap

#### 2.1 Report Design Basics
- **SSRS Architecture**: Report Server, Data Source, Report Definition.
- **Report Types**: Table, Matrix, Chart, List, Subreport.
- **Deployment**: How to deploy reports to the Report Server.
- **Report Viewer**: Accessing reports through a web browser.

#### 2.2 Report Design Basics
- **Creating Reports**: How to create basic reports using Report Builder or SSDT.
- **Data Sources and Datasets**: Creating and configuring connections to SQL Server, Excel, or other data sources.
- **Basic Report Layout**: Working with tables, matrices, and charts.
- **Grouping and Sorting**: Applying grouping and sorting to data.

#### 2.3 Advanced Report Design
- **Parameters**: Adding and handling report parameters.
- **Expressions**: Using expressions for dynamic content.
- **Subreports**: Creating and linking subreports.
- **Drill-through Reports**: Enabling drill-through functionality.
- **Custom Code**: Writing custom code for complex reporting needs.
- **Conditional Formatting**: Applying different styles based on data conditions.

#### 2.4 Report Delivery & Security
- **Subscriptions**: How to schedule and automate report delivery.
- **Security**: Role-based security for report access.
- **Report Caching**: Using caching for improved performance.
- **Rendering Formats**: Exporting reports to PDF, Excel, Word, etc.

#### 2.5 SSRS Performance Optimization
- **Report Caching**: How to implement and manage caching to improve performance.
- **Data Source Optimization**: How to optimize queries for faster report rendering.
- **Report Design Optimization**: Techniques to design more efficient reports (reducing excessive data).

### Problem Statements/Questions for SSRS:
1. Create an SSRS report that displays sales by region. The report should include drill-through functionality to show detailed sales data.
2. Design a parameterized report where the user can select the start and end date for a sales report.
3. Create an SSRS report with dynamic formatting, where the background color of a row changes based on the total sales value.
4. Implement a subscription that emails a report every Monday at 9 AM.
5. How would you improve the performance of an SSRS report that is running very slowly due to large dataset queries?
6. Implement a report using a subreport to show details when a user clicks on a summary report entry.
