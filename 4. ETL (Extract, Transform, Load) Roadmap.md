## 4. ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Roadmap

### Overview
ETL is the process of extracting data from various sources, transforming it into the required format, and loading it into a data warehouse or database.

### Roadmap

#### 4.1 ETL Concepts
- **ETL Process Overview**: Extraction, Transformation, Loading.
- **ETL Tools**: SSIS, Informatica, Talend, Apache Nifi, etc.
- **Data Sources**: Structured vs Unstructured Data, APIs, flat files, etc.
- **Transformation Rules**: Data cleansing, aggregation, filtering, mapping.

#### 4.2 ETL Design
- **Designing an ETL Pipeline**: Step-by-step design of an ETL process.
- **Data Transformation Techniques**: Aggregation, pivoting, joins, unions.
- **Error Handling in ETL**: How to handle data transformation errors.
- **Scheduling and Automation**: Using tools like cron, SQL Server Agent for scheduling.

#### 4.3 ETL Performance Optimization
- **Data Volume**: Optimizing ETL for large datasets.
- **Parallel Processing**: Using parallelism in ETL for faster execution.
- **Incremental Loads**: Loading only changed data to improve performance.

### Problem Statements/Questions for ETL:
1. Design an ETL process using SSIS that extracts data from a CSV file, transforms it (e.g., standardize date formats), and loads it into a SQL Server database.
2. Implement an incremental load process to only extract new or modified data from a source system.
3. How would you optimize the performance of an ETL process that is taking too long to run due to large volume data?
4. Create a process that handles data errors in the ETL pipeline by logging and redirecting invalid rows to an error table.
